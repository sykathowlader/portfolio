        description={`Developed a full-stack web application to control Govee Smart LED lights, integrating a React frontend 
          with a Node.js and Express backend via the Govee API. Users can select from five colors, red, blue, green, yellow, 
          and orange, each triggering a unique audio track that reflects the emotion conveyed by that color, such as 
          intensity for red or calmness for blue. The frontend, built with React, features a responsive grid of color boxes 
          and a turn-off button, leveraging state management to handle color selection, API requests, and audio playback in a 
          seamless loop. The backend uses Express to handle POST requests, simultaneously updating two LED devices with RGB 
          values or turning them off, all powered by asynchronous fetch calls to the Govee API. Sensitive data, including 
          API keys, device MAC addresses, and model numbers, are securely stored in an .env file and accessed via 
          the dotenv package. Deployed the backend on Render and the frontend on Vercel, utilizing environment 
          variables for flexible API routing between local and production environments.`}

          Technologies used included Python, OpenCV for preprocessing, scikit-learn
