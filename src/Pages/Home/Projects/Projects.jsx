          In my second year of university, I worked on a group project to build a 
          plane ticket sales system for a fictional travel agency, Air Via Ltd. 
          We developed it from scratch, creating use case and class diagrams, 
          designing the database entity-relationship diagram (ERD), and coding it 
          with Java and JavaFX. I focused on the class diagram and implementation, 
          using MySQL for the database. Our project ranked in the top three of our 
          cohort, meeting all requirements with a sleek, user-friendly GUI.
